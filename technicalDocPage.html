                    Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.

                    However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).

                    We believe in that using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.

                    Follow the steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit.

                    Windows 8 or later:

                    Open the Start Screen (the window symbol at the bottom left on your screen). Type Notepad.

                    Windows 7 or earlier:

                    Open Start > Programs > Accessories > Notepad

                    All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration:

                    The
                    declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages
                    correctly.

                    It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

                    The
                    declaration is not case sensitive.

                    An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:
